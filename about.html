<p>Assalamualaikum and Hi.My name is Siti Fatihah binti Pafli or my friends often call me, Tiha.
 Officially 20 this upcoming December.Currently in my last semester of Diploma in Information Management.
Books,foods and musics are my kind of escapism to get rid of stress because of lot of assignments given.
So far, that is all you have to know about me. (did not have any intention to fully reveal about myself
because I wanna give that mysterious vibes :)).Till then,bye.
